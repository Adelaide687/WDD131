            <div>
                <h3>Isaiah 53:3-5</h3>
                <p>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows⁠, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</p>
                <p>Surely he hath borne our griefs⁠, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>
                <p>But he was wounded for our transgressions⁠, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed⁠.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>John 3:16</h3>
                <p>For God so loved the world⁠, that he gave his only begotten Son⁠, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life⁠.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Alma 34:9-10</h3>
                <p>For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</p>
                <p>For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</p>
